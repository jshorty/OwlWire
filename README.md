#OwlWire

[Check out OwlWire here!][link]

Owlwire allows you to see the most recent report of any North American owl.
The app queries the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology's eBird API and
returns a result using a Google Maps embed. I built this to learn about Flask and Python.

## Next Steps:
- [ ] Refactor & apply best practices, esp. to large business logic methods
- [ ] Integrate responsiveness (jQuery? Maybe just more elegant layout) to UI
- [ ] Stay alert from benefits this project could draw from [Chickadee][chickadee]'s resources
