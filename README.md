#OwlWire

Owlwire allows you to see the most recent report of any North American owl.
The app queries the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology's eBird API and
returns a result using a Google Maps embed. This was a personal project for
learning how to build a web app with Flask and Python (read: not focused on CSS), and only works fully
in Chrome or Safari. Enjoy!

A demo of Owlwire is currently hosted at (http://jshorty.pythonanywhere.com)
