OwlWire is a Python script using the flask framework to view the most recent sightings of North American owls by querying the eBird API (https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBird+API+1.1) for the most recent report data on a given species. HTML framework and CSS are included to make it look nice.
